Aave V2 Wallet Credit Scoring — Data Analysis & Strategic Insights
1. Executive Summary
This document presents a comprehensive analysis of wallet-level credit risk leveraging transaction data from the Aave V2 DeFi protocol. Our end-to-end workflow extracts key behavioral features, applies a robust heuristic scoring methodology, and generates normalized credit scores on a 0–1000 scale across 3,497 unique wallets. The framework facilitates actionable risk stratification, enabling informed lending decisions and portfolio risk management in decentralized finance ecosystems.

2. Dataset & Transaction Overview
Data Source: 99,752 cleaned, timestamped transaction records capturing wallet interactions such as deposits, borrows, repayments, liquidations, and redeems.

Wallet Population: 3,497 unique wallet addresses analyzed for creditworthiness.

Transaction Types: Dominated by deposits and borrows, with repayments and liquidations providing critical risk signals.

Temporal Scope: Multi-month data providing longitudinal insight into wallet behavior dynamics.

3. Feature Engineering Summary
We engineered wallet-level behavioral features grounded in domain expertise and DeFi risk indicators:

Feature	Description
total_deposits	Number of deposit transactions per wallet, indicating capital inflow and engagement level.
total_borrows	Number of borrow transactions, reflecting credit utilization frequency.
repay_to_borrow_ratio	Sum of repayments divided by sum of borrows, measuring repayment discipline and credit reliability.
avg_borrow_repay_time	Average elapsed time (in seconds) between borrow and repay transactions, capturing timeliness of repayment.
liquidation_count	Frequency of liquidation events, serving as a key negative risk factor.
active_days	Duration in days between first and last transaction, reflecting wallet maturity.
tx_frequency	Average transactions per active day, indicating operational activity intensity.
unique_tx_types	Count of distinct transaction types performed, proxying for behavioral diversity and sophistication.

All features were carefully normalized and aggregated at the wallet level to ensure comparability and stability in scoring.

4. Heuristic Scoring Model
The credit scoring function applies weighted linear combinations reflecting the relative risk impact of each feature:

python
Copy code
score = (
    total_deposits * 10 +
    repay_to_borrow_ratio * 100 +
    (1 / (avg_borrow_repay_time + 1)) * 500000 +
    tx_frequency * 200 -
    liquidation_count * 200
)
Positive weights emphasize deposit volume, repayment discipline, prompt repayment timing, and wallet activity.

Liquidation events incur substantial penalties, lowering creditworthiness.

Final scores are scaled to a 0–1000 range using min-max normalization to standardize across wallets.

5. Results & Key Insights
Score Distribution: Wallet scores span approximately 100 to over 600, indicating diverse risk profiles with identifiable high- and low-risk cohorts.

Risk Correlations: Wallets with low or zero liquidations consistently achieve higher scores; repayment ratios strongly correlate with creditworthiness.

Activity Patterns: High-frequency and behaviorally diverse wallets generally score better, demonstrating operational sophistication.

Temporal Behavior: Longer active wallets tend to have moderate to good scores, highlighting experience as a risk mitigator.

6. Business Implications
The scoring framework delivers actionable wallet credit assessments crucial for dynamic lending strategies in DeFi.

Enables risk stratification to optimize interest rates, borrowing limits, and liquidation thresholds.

Facilitates proactive risk monitoring to identify and mitigate potential defaults before they impact portfolio health.

Supports data-driven governance and compliance by providing transparent, auditable credit metrics.

7. Future Roadmap
Integrate machine learning models for predictive scoring based on temporal trends and feature interactions.

Enrich feature sets with off-chain analytics, social sentiment, and multi-protocol data for holistic wallet profiling.

Develop real-time streaming pipelines to dynamically update wallet scores, enabling continuous risk monitoring.

Deploy scalable, containerized scoring services integrated with lending platforms through API-driven architectures.
